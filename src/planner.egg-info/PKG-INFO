# Extending Probabilistic Motion Prediction Models with Planning Module

## Getting Started

### Prepare Environment

The implementation of SeNeVA requires Python 3.10, PyTorch 2.0+ and Lightning 2.0+. If you are using Anaconda/Miniconda environment, you can create the virtual environment by running the following line inside the root directory:

```bash
$ conda env create -f conda/environment.yaml
Channels:
 - conda-forge
 - defaults
 - base
Platform: linux-64
